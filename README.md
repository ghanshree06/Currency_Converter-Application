The Java code implements a simple currency converter using Swing for the graphical interface.
It allows users to input an amount, select the currencies for conversion (from USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, INR), and then displays the converted amount.
The program defines fixed conversion rates and performs currency conversion based on user selection when the "Convert" button is clicked.
